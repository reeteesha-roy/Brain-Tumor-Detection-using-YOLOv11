# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-YOLOv11

Description:
This project leverages YOLOv11n.pt (You Only Look Once) to detect and classify brain tumors in medical images. Using deep learning and computer vision, this model identifies and locates brain tumors, assisting in early detection and diagnosis. The project utilizes pre-trained weights and fine-tunes them on a brain tumor dataset to achieve high accuracy in tumor localization.

Key Features:
Real-time object detection using YOLOv11, optimized for brain tumor images.
Localization and classification of brain tumors.
Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation of medical images.
Evaluation metrics: Performance measured using accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), and precision/recall.
Transfer learning: Fine-tuned model for better performance on the brain tumor dataset.

Prerequisites:
•	High-performance GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3080 or above).
•	Minimum 16 GB RAM and 500 GB storage.
•	Python 3.9 or later.
•	PyTorch and Ultralytics libraries

Conclusion:
High accuracy of 98% after 20 epochs.
