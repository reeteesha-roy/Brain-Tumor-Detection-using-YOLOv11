# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-YOLOv11
A Python implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, designed for real-time detection and localization of objects in images and videos. This project uses the pre-trained YOLOv11 model to identify and classify objects in various categories.
